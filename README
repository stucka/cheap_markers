What you want is probably in the placemarkers.xls file.

This creates simple colored circles for maps using ImageMagick, which
can be converted into Base64 and embedded directly, as in the .xls or 
.html file included with this package. The pins are sorta kinda along
the lines of the Google Fusion Tables map markers with similar names.

This project made much more sense before I took the second cold medicine
with a Peroni.
